## Billing Engine where you Bring Your Own PSP 

The main goal of this project is to create a billing engine where you get to bring your own 
Payment provider to process payments and use it for your billing logic.

Depending on your market, this problem is pretty much solved for by companies like Paddle, and 
even now recently Polar will get it nail down.

This project comes into  markets where these products are not supported, primarly the African market 
where people transact via mobile money networks. This project is for those markets.

The initial Target market is African market where people transact with Mobile Money. This doesn't mean we only support these countries parse, but I have designed the project with an initial focus is to make it work on these market first.

Still Early, and you can submit an issue and bug report or even better a PR.

Cheers.
